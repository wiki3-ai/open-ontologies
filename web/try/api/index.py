"""Try it here: one sheet in, one ontology out, on the pinned engine.

One Vercel Python function, no reimplementation. Every request writes the
sheet to a scratch directory and runs the SAME `open-ontologies` binary a
user would download, in `batch` mode, and returns what it printed. The page
shows the engine's words, including the sentence that says an induced
ontology is a hypothesis about the sheet and not a truth about the domain.

Routes (all under /api/, the rewrite passes the tail as ?p=):
  GET  samples            the bundled sample sheets

  POST check              {name, csv, ontology_ttl, shapes_ttl, mapping} -> the engine's SHACL report
