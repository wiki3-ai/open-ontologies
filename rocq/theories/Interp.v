(** * An RDF-based interpretation, and the semantic conditions the built-in
      rules are discharged against.

    [Semantics.v] gives the RULE-RELATIVE warrant, which assumes the rule table.
    This file is what is needed to get rid of that assumption for the built-in
    table: a notion of model in which the RDFS and OWL vocabulary MEANS
    something, so that the built-in rules can be derived rather than assumed.

    R-INT-1. THE SHAPE IS THE RDF-BASED ONE: a domain, a total denotation, and a
    ternary extension relation. [iext I p x y] reads "the pair <x, y> is in
    IEXT(p)". Classes are read off the extension relation in the standard way,
    [ICEXT(c) = { x : <x, c> in IEXT(I(rdf:type)) }], rather than carried as a
    second field, because carrying it as a field would let an interpretation
    make a class extension disagree with the type triples that name it.

    R-INT-2. [iden] IS TOTAL ON TERMS. Every field of the certificate denotes,
    including one that is not writable RDF. This is a real restriction on the
    model class and it runs in the UNSAFE direction: interpretations in which
    some literal fails to denote are outside the claim. It is stated here rather
    than buried because the alternative, a partial denotation, would make
    [itrue] partial, and a three-valued truth would change the meaning of every
    theorem in the development. OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics takes IL total, which
    is the precedent, and the claim is scoped to interpretations that do.

    R-INT-3. IC AND IP ARE FIELDS, not derived. RDFS conditions are stated with
    membership in IC and IP as a side condition ("then x, y are in IC and
    ICEXT(x) is a subset of ICEXT(y)"), and the conditions that run backwards
    need those memberships as HYPOTHESES. Deriving IC from the graph would make
    the backward conditions harder to satisfy and the model class smaller, which
    is the wrong direction.

    R-INT-4. THE CONDITIONS ARE SEPARATE DEFINITIONS, NOT FIELDS OF ONE RECORD,
    AND EVERY RULE LEMMA TAKES EXACTLY THE ONES IT USES. This is the only part
    of the design that is about honesty rather than about mathematics. A rule
    lemma proved from a record can be proved from a field that says the rule,
    and nothing in the proof script shows the difference. With the conditions as
    explicit hypotheses the dependency is IN THE STATEMENT, so a reader counting
    which arms consume a backward condition is reading a machine-checked fact
    rather than a comment. The count is fourteen and [Builtin.v] is where it can
    be checked.

    R-INT-5. THE BACKWARD CONDITIONS ARE A MODELLING DECISION AND THEY ARE THE
    WEAKEST POINT OF THE ABSOLUTE CLAIM. RDFS alone states its conditions as
    implications: "if <x, y> is in IEXT(I(rdfs:subClassOf)) then ...". Fourteen
    of the twenty-seven built-in rows CONCLUDE a [subClassOf], [subPropertyOf],
    [domain] or [range] triple, and no implication in that direction licenses
    them. The OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics states the corresponding conditions as
    biconditionals, which is what makes those rows derivable, and a
    biconditional is a STRONGER condition: it admits fewer interpretations, so
    the model class is smaller and entailment over it is a WEAKER claim than
    entailment over the RDFS conditions alone. Adding [C_..._bwd] to the
    hypothesis list of a lemma is therefore never free, and the lemmas that need
    it say so in their own statement.

    WHERE THE BICONDITIONAL READING COMES FROM, AND WHAT WAS NOT DONE. It is
    taken from this repository's own correction to decision 0002, which names
    the connective in the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics table that carries
    [rowspan="4"] in the specification's HTML and therefore states an [iff]
    rather than the [if-then] RDFS alone gives. It was NOT re-checked cell by
    cell against the Recommendation in this work. That check is one of the
    things [rocq/README.md] lists as not covered, and it is the largest single
    piece of prose the absolute theorem rests on. A reader who wants the
    absolute verdict to mean what it says should do that reading before
    trusting it. *)
