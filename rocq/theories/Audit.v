(** * The axiom footprint.

    A machine-checked proof is only as good as the list of things it took on
    trust, and that list is not visible from reading the proof. [Print
    Assumptions] is, so it is run here on every theorem this development
    advertises, and [rocq/build.sh] fails the build unless every one of them
    reports being closed under the global context.

    THE GATE CAN FAIL, and the way to see it fail is written down rather than
    asserted: add [Axiom cheat : False.] to any file below and rebuild, or
    replace a [Qed] with [Admitted]. The build script greps for the exact
    phrase, so an admitted proof turns the line into a list of constants and
    the grep stops matching. [rocq/build.sh --prove-the-gate-can-fail] does
    exactly that against a scratch copy and requires the build to break.

    [Print Assumptions] prints its verdict and NOT the name it is about, so fifteen
    consecutive "Closed under the global context" lines are unreadable and, worse,
    unattributable: a reader cannot tell which theorem is missing if fourteen of them
    print. Each one below is therefore preceded by a [Check], whose output carries the
    name and the statement, so the report reads as fifteen labelled pairs and
    [build.sh] can require fifteen of them.

    Nothing here is a theorem. This file adds no content and is a report. *)
